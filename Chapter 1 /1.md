# Chapter 1: Scalable Frontend Architecture

## What is scalability ?
Scalability means the code is easy to extend, maintain, test, and debug, even as the application grows. Components and libraries are reusable, and different teams can work on separate parts of the application. The application should have good performance, small bundle sizes, and low compile and build times. Achieving this requires a good architecture, tools, and rules.

## Frontend Architecture
- Architecture includes elements such as your repository type, folder structure, architectural patterns, design patterns, a programming language, framework, and tools for building, testing, linting, and deploying the application.
- Good architectural decisions create a fast, loosely coupled, testable system, avoiding direct dependencies to prevent extensive refactoring when business introduces changes.
