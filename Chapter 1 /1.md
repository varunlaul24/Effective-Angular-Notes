# Chapter 1: Scalable Frontend Architecture

## What is scalability ?
**Scalability** means the code is easy to extend, maintain, test, and debug, even as the application grows. Components and libraries are reusable, and different teams can work on separate parts of the application. The application should have good performance, small bundle sizes, and low compile and build times. Achieving this requires a good architecture, tools, and rules.

## Frontend Architecture
- Architecture includes elements such as our repository type, folder structure, architectural patterns, design patterns, a programming language, framework, and tools for building, testing, linting, and deploying the application.
- Good architectural decisions create a fast, loosely coupled, testable system, avoiding direct dependencies to prevent extensive refactoring when business introduces changes.

## Monorepo or Polyrepo
These are the two options for storing code within a source control application such as GitHub. If we create a new repository for each project or application, it’s called a **polyrepo** or **multi-repos structure**. Meanwhile, when all applications are in one large repository, it’s called a **monorepo structure**. For large companies, a monorepo can easily contain hundreds of applications.

### Advantages of Monorepos
- **Easy code sharing:** Prevent duplicate code,
get guidance on solving similar issues, and in checking if a bug originates in our code or the implementation of a library by inspecting or reusing code from another project and sharing things in libraries.
- **Uniformity among different applications:** Ensures that the same tooling is used, code conventions and best practices are applied, and all applications are tested similarly. Also, testing the entire system is easier with a monorepo.
- **No versioning conflicts:** It also ensures that applications that are not actively developed still get regular updates for their dependencies.
- **Cross-project refactoring:** Refactor something that occurs in many applications, we can do it in one go for all applications or efficiently run scripts to perform these actions.
- **Quick code movement and debugging**
- **Shared commit timeline:** This makes it safe to create atomic commits with changes in multiple applications. This happens because if anything goes wrong, we can always revert to a common state of all applications through the commit timeline.

### Disdvantages of Monorepos
- **Large folder structure:** Because it’s so
easy to use code from other projects, we need to be extra careful not to create unwanted dependencies between applications.
- **Complex package updates:** All projects need to update at once.
- **Breaking changes:** When we make changes in libraries, we can break other applications without noticing it.
- **Slow build times:** If not managed correctly.
- **Challenges in deployment**

***Note:*** Most disadvantages can be mitigated with the right tools. For example, Nx.

### Advantages of Polyrepos
- **A higher level of isolation between applications**
- **Flexibility with dependency management**
- **Individual tooling**
- **Easy to manage**
- **Straightforward modular deployment**
- **In-line with a micro front-end architecture:** However, micro frontends can be achieved with both a monorepo and polyrepo structure.

### Disdvantages of Polyrepos
- **Difficulties in code sharing**
- **Boundaries between projects and libraries:** When we depend on a library that resides in another repository, and we run into a bug, it will be more time-consuming to fix the issue.
- **Challenges when testing multiple repositories**
- **Difficulties in creating CI/CD pipelines and deployments:** More challenging as we need multiple repositories to complete the tasks.
- **Dependency conflicts:** Different applications need to work together in production and can
depend on similar dependencies. We can encounter compatibility issues when these applications use different versions of the set dependency.

## Architectural Patterns
Architectural patterns focus on how we structure our code and provide rules for abstracting business logic away from specific implementations. Doing so gives us a loosely coupled system that is easy to test, change, and expand without creating dependencies in the wrong places.

### MVC
- The MVC pattern is often used for Angular applications because it fits well with the tools provided by the framework. MVC consists of three parts – the model, the view, and the controller:
  - The ***model*** declares the data models and handles business and data related logic.
  - The ***view*** displays the current state of the model to the user.
  - The ***controller*** acts as a bridge between the view and the model. The controller passes the user input to the model so that the model can perform actions and update accordingly, after which the controller returns the updated values to the view.
- If we translate this pattern into an Angular application, the model would be a service handling the data and data models. The view would be the HTML template. Finally, the controller would be the TypeScript file behind the HTML file, commonly named the component class. A better implementation is considering the component class as part of the view and having an extra facade service (an additional abstraction layer creating a simple interface and communication layer between the view and business or state-related logic of our application) between the model service and the view acting as the controller.

Keeping true to the MVC architecture’s original implementation, the model directly gives the updated values to the view. To achieve this, we would eliminate steps 4 and 5 and would then go to the view instead of the controller. In Angular, this is sort of the case when using the component class as a controller, and it results in a tight coupling between the business logic and the component classes. We can add a separate facade service that acts as a controller to fully separate the component classes from the business and state layers of the app. By separating the components from the state and business logic, we end up with a loose coupling, making it easier to change implementations throughout the app.

### Hexagonal
Hexagonal Architecture gained popularity because domain driven development (DDD) became a hot topic. The main principle of hexagonal architecture is to separate the core application logic away from the UI and data implementation through ports and adapters. Because of that, the architecture is also commonly referred to as the ports and adapter architecture.
- ***Ports*** - Interfaces (or abstract classes) that separate core logic from the UI and code implementations. These interfaces dictate how the UI and code implementations can communicate with application core. 
- ***Adapters*** - UI and code implementations that connect with application core through the ports.

![Hexagonal Pattern](/assets/1.3HexagonalArchitecture.png "Hexagonal Pattern")

In hexagonal architecture, each domain has ports and adapters. A facade service can be used between port interfaces and adapters to add abstraction between the UI, implementations, and core. The facade itself acts as a port, provided it implements an interface, ensuring consistent communication with the core and adapters. Ports define rules for communication with the application core, allowing you to easily swap UI components or change data implementations without affecting business logic or views. The new implementation just needs to connect to the same interface that the ports are using. This ensures flexibility and a loosely coupled system. <br><br>
**Translating Hexagonal Architecture into an Angular App:**
- ***Primary Adapters:*** Everything the user faces, or triggers - components, directives, resolvers, guards, and event listeners.
- ***Primary Ports:*** TypeScript interfaces (or facade services) which dictate how the UI layer communicates with the application core.
- ***Application Core:*** Here, we access state management and define business and application logic in Angular services.
- ***Secondary Ports:*** TypeScript interfaces (or facade services) which dictate how the application code communicates with HTTP services, state management, in-memory
persistence, event dispatchers, and other data or API related logic.
- ***Secondary Adapters:*** These implement our HTTP services, local storage persistence, state management, and event dispatchers.

### Layered
It uses different layers to separate concerns. There are at least 3 main layers: the core layer, the abstraction layer, and the presentation layer. Within these top-level layers, we can have additional sub-layers or sibling elements. Each layer can only communicate with the layer above and below itself; the rest of the layers in the chain are off limits.

#### Presentation Layer
- ***Dumb Components:*** They only have component inputs to receive data and outputs to alert the parent components something has changed. 
- ***Wrapper Components:*** These are also dumb, but they are used to group multiple components and provide a reusable layout or
animation. Even though a wrapper container can wrap around dumb components, they are the same for the flow of data and separation of dependencies.
- ***Smart Components:*** These components are specific business use cases or pages, and they inject facade services and implement component logic and state.

#### Abstraction Layer
Here, we have facade services which are regular Angular services that implement the facade design pattern. These facade services provide additional abstraction and are used as a bridge between our smart components and the core layer of the application.

#### Core Layer
Here, the global state management, business and application logic, and HTTP services reside. Our HTTP services layer lies on top of the state management and business logic layers. We have separate services that do nothing but fetch data and pass it to our other core layers; the lower core layers never fetch data directly, so we have an additional abstraction layer and have better separation of concerns.

### Comparing the 3 Patterns
- MVC is simple but can lead to a tightly coupled view and business logic if not managed carefully, especially without facade services, which can result in too many dependencies and implementations in the component classes. This can cause frequent DOM updates and make testing difficult.
- Hexagonal architecture promotes easy implementation changes and simple unit testing through ports and adapters but adds complexity and boilerplate.
- Layered architecture combines the benefits of MVC and hexagonal, offering clear separation and flexibility. It's easier to understand and suits teams with varying experience levels, allowing for easy implementation changes and smooth testing.
