# Chapter 1: Scalable Frontend Architecture

## What is scalability ?
**Scalability** means the code is easy to extend, maintain, test, and debug, even as the application grows. Components and libraries are reusable, and different teams can work on separate parts of the application. The application should have good performance, small bundle sizes, and low compile and build times. Achieving this requires a good architecture, tools, and rules.

## Frontend Architecture
- Architecture includes elements such as our repository type, folder structure, architectural patterns, design patterns, a programming language, framework, and tools for building, testing, linting, and deploying the application.
- Good architectural decisions create a fast, loosely coupled, testable system, avoiding direct dependencies to prevent extensive refactoring when business introduces changes.

## Monorepo or Polyrepo
These are the two options for storing code within a source control application such as GitHub. If we create a new repository for each project or application, it’s called a **polyrepo** or **multi-repos structure**. Meanwhile, when all applications are in one large repository, it’s called a **monorepo structure**. For large companies, a monorepo can easily contain hundreds of applications.

### Advantages of Monorepos
- **Easy code sharing:** Prevent duplicate code,
get guidance on solving similar issues, and in checking if a bug originates in our code or the implementation of a library by inspecting or reusing code from another project and sharing things in libraries.
- **Uniformity among different applications:** Ensures that the same tooling is used, code conventions and best practices are applied, and all applications are tested similarly. Also, testing the entire system is easier with a monorepo.
- **No versioning conflicts:** It also ensures that applications that are not actively developed still get regular updates for their dependencies.
- **Cross-project refactoring:** Refactor something that occurs in many applications, we can do it in one go for all applications or efficiently run scripts to perform these actions.
- **Quick code movement and debugging**
- **Shared commit timeline:** This makes it safe to create atomic commits with changes in multiple applications. This happens because if anything goes wrong, we can always revert to a common state of all applications through the commit timeline.

### Disdvantages of Monorepos
- **Large folder structure:** Because it’s so
easy to use code from other projects, we need to be extra careful not to create unwanted dependencies between applications.
- **Complex package updates:** All projects need to update at once.
- **Breaking changes:** When we make changes in libraries, we can break other applications without noticing it.
- **Slow build times:** If not managed correctly.
- **Challenges in deployment**

***Note:*** Most disadvantages can be mitigated with the right tools. For example, Nx.

### Advantages of Polyrepos
- **A higher level of isolation between applications**
- **Flexibility with dependency management**
- **Individual tooling**
- **Easy to manage**
- **Straightforward modular deployment**
- **In-line with a micro front-end architecture:** However, micro frontends can be achieved with both a monorepo and polyrepo structure.

### Disdvantages of Polyrepos
- **Difficulties in code sharing**
- **Boundaries between projects and libraries:** When we depend on a library that resides in another repository, and we run into a bug, it will be more time-consuming to fix the issue.
- **Challenges when testing multiple repositories**
- **Difficulties in creating CI/CD pipelines and deployments:** More challenging as we need multiple repositories to complete the tasks.
- **Dependency conflicts:** Different applications need to work together in production and can
depend on similar dependencies. We can encounter compatibility issues when these applications use different versions of the set dependency.
